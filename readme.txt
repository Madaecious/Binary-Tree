The project contains the following source code files:

•	BinaryNode.java: defines the binary node class
•	BinaryTree.java: defines the binary tree class
•	BinaryTreeInterface.java: the interface that the binary tree class implements
•	ClientProgram.java: the client program that constructs a binary tree and demonstrates
    both tree- and node-level recursive methods
•	Hardcoded Binary Tree.jpg: diagram of the hardcoded binary tree

The console output is divided into three sections:
•	demonstrations of the tree-level methods
•	demonstrations of the node-level methods
•	demonstrations of calling from Node C
